# Node For Max Core Examples
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Cycling74/n4m-core-examples.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Cycling74/n4m-core-examples)

This repository contains the code examples for the Node For Max package, maintained by [@Cycling74](https://github.com/Cycling74). It's main purpose is to show basic techniques when using `Node For Max` and teach how to use the API.

## Getting Started with Node For Max

Hello Maxers! If you're looking for resources to learn more about Node For Max, you're in the right place.

### API Reference

You can find the full API Reference [here](https://docs.cycling74.com/nodeformax/api/index.html).

### Core Examples

If you're completely new to Node For Max, we recommend starting here, with the core examples. These are small and show you how to do basic things you'll probably want to do again and again. Each folder is a self-contained example, containing at a minimum a Max patch and a JavaScript file. Cycling '74 will continue adding more examples, so keep checking back!

### Bigger Examples, made by Cycling '74.

[n4m-examples](https://github.com/cycling74/n4m-examples) is a collection of real-live examples created and maintained by Cycling '74. These are usually larger in size than the core examples. Cycling '74 will continue to add more, so keep checking back!

### Recipes

* Socket Drawings - a recipe that demonstrates how to create a web socket server and have users interact with your Max patch from the Internet. [Recipe](https://cycling74.com/tutorials/node-recipe-00-socket-drawings) | [GitHub](https://github.com/pixlpa/socket-drawings)
