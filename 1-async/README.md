# Async

JavaScript is synchronous, blocking, and single-threaded. What does this mean? It means that only one operation can happen at a time. What if something is taking a long time to execute? JavaScript can be used in a asynchronous way. This comes up a lot when working with APIs and making network requests (for example, if you wanted to interact with the Twitter API), reading files on your computer (for example, loading a MIDI file), reading and writing to a dict, and many other times.

This example will demonstrate how to work with asynchronous JavaScript.
