I have verified that this pull request:

* [ ] there are no linting errors -- `npm run lint`, from the root of the n4m-examples repository
* [ ] is from a uniquely-named feature branch and has been rebased on top of the latest master. (If I was asked to make more changes, I have made sure to rebase onto master then too)
* [ ] is descriptively named and links to an issue number, i.e. `Fixes #123`

Thank you!
